**Thirst** is a simple mod that adds a thirst mechanic to the game, but that fits in modpacks for the newer versions of Minecraft by adding original features and compatibility with a lot of often-used mods.

This mod is heavily inspired by the other thirst/survival mods out there, including Dehydration, Tough as Nails and Cold Sweat.
